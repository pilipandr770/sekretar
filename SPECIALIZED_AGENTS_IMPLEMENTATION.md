# Specialized Agents Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented task 5.3 "Implement specialized agents" from the AI Secretary SaaS specification. This implementation includes four specialized AI agents with context-aware response generation, knowledge base integration, and comprehensive testing.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Specialized Agents (`app/secretary/agents/specialized_agents.py`)

#### SalesAgent
- **Purpose**: Handles sales inquiries, lead qualification, pricing questions, and product demos
- **Key Features**:
  - Intent analysis (pricing, demo, trial, purchase, comparison)
  - Lead qualification scoring (low, medium, high)
  - Knowledge base integration for accurate product information
  - Automatic lead creation for qualified prospects
  - Suggested actions (create_lead, schedule_demo, send_pricing, etc.)

#### SupportAgent
- **Purpose**: Provides technical support, troubleshooting, and help with product issues
- **Key Features**:
  - Issue categorization (technical, account, billing, feature_request, how_to, bug_report)
  - Severity assessment (low, medium, high, critical)
  - Knowledge base search for solutions and troubleshooting guides
  - Automatic escalation for critical issues
  - Technical term extraction for better knowledge search

#### BillingAgent
- **Purpose**: Manages billing inquiries, subscription questions, and payment issues
- **Key Features**:
  - Billing category detection (payment_issue, subscription, invoice, refund, trial)
  - Sensitive data detection and security awareness
  - Account access requirement assessment
  - Automatic escalation for sensitive financial matters
  - Secure handling of billing information

#### OperationsAgent
- **Purpose**: Handles general business inquiries, company information, and operational questions
- **Key Features**:
  - Inquiry type classification (business_hours, contact_info, company_info, services)
  - Self-service capability assessment
  - General business information provision
  - Knowledge base integration for company policies and information

### 2. Agent Orchestrator (`app/secretary/agents/orchestrator.py`)

- **Purpose**: Coordinates all agents in a complete processing pipeline
- **Key Features**:
  - Input content filtering via SupervisorAgent
  - Intent detection and routing via RouterAgent
  - Specialized agent processing
  - Output validation via SupervisorAgent
  - Error handling and fallback responses
  - Direct agent routing capability
  - Agent status and capability reporting

### 3. Knowledge Base Integration

All agents integrate with the existing `KnowledgeService` to:
- Search for relevant information based on customer queries
- Include citations and source references in responses
- Provide accurate, contextual information
- Handle knowledge search failures gracefully

### 4. Context-Aware Response Generation

Each agent uses OpenAI API for:
- Intent and sentiment analysis
- Context-aware response generation
- Confidence scoring
- Escalation decision making
- Fallback analysis when AI services are unavailable

### 5. Comprehensive Testing (`tests/test_specialized_agents.py`)

- **Test Coverage**: 19 test cases covering all agents and orchestrator
- **Test Types**:
  - Unit tests for individual agent functionality
  - Integration tests for agent orchestration
  - Fallback behavior testing
  - Error handling validation
  - Mock-based testing for external dependencies

### ✅ Agent Orchestration
- Complete message processing pipeline
- Content filtering (input and output)
- Intent detection and routing
- Error handling and fallbacks
- Agent status monitoring
- Direct agent routing capability

### ✅ Knowledge Base Integration
- Search functionality across all agents
- Citation tracking and source referencing
- Graceful handling of search failures
- Context-aware search term extraction
- Integration with existing KnowledgeService

### ✅ Testing and Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive unit test suite (19 tests)
- Mock-based testing for external dependencies
- Error handling validation
- Fallback behavior testing
- Integration testing for orchestrator

## Requirements Verification

### Requirement 2.3 ✅
- **"WHEN intent is detected THEN the system SHALL route messages to appropriate agents (Sales/Support/Billing/Operations)"**
- Implemented: RouterAgent detects intent and AgentOrchestrator routes to appropriate specialized agents

### Requirement 5.3 ✅
- **"WHEN customer questions are asked THEN the system SHALL search the knowledge base for relevant information"**
- Implemented: All agents integrate with KnowledgeService for contextual information retrieval

### Requirement 5.4 ✅
- **"WHEN providing AI responses THEN the system SHALL include citations and source references"**
- Implemented: All agents include citations from knowledge base results in their responses

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture
- **Base Agent Pattern**: All agents inherit from `BaseAgent` for consistent interface
- **Async Processing**: Full async/await support for concurrent operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with fallback mechanisms
- **Logging**: Structured logging for monitoring and debugging

### OpenAI Integration
- **Model**: Uses GPT-4 Turbo Preview for optimal performance
- **Prompts**: Specialized system prompts for each agent type
- **Fallbacks**: Keyword-based analysis when AI services are unavailable
- **Rate Limiting**: Proper error handling for API limitations

### Data Models Integration
- **CRM Integration**: Sales agent integrates with Lead, Contact, Pipeline models
- **Tenant Isolation**: All agents respect multi-tenant architecture
- **Security**: Proper handling of sensitive data and PII

## Demo and Examples

Created `examples/specialized_agents_demo.py` demonstrating:
- Individual agent capabilities
- Complete orchestrator flow
- Knowledge base integration
- Error handling and fallbacks
- Agent status and capabilities reporting

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `app/secretary/agents/specialized_agents.py` - Main implementation
- `app/secretary/agents/orchestrator.py` - Agent coordination
- `tests/test_specialized_agents.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `examples/specialized_agents_demo.py` - Demo script
- `SPECIALIZED_AGENTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This summary

### Modified Files
- `app/secretary/agents/__init__.py` - Added exports for new agents

## Performance Considerations

- **Async Operations**: All agent processing is asynchronous
- **Knowledge Search**: Configurable search limits and similarity thresholds
- **Caching**: Leverages existing Redis caching for knowledge results
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## Security Features

- **Content Filtering**: Input and output filtering via SupervisorAgent
- **PII Detection**: Automatic detection and masking of sensitive information
- **Access Control**: Billing agent requires account access for sensitive operations
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all agent interactions

## Next Steps

The specialized agents are now ready for integration with:
1. **Channel Integrations** (Task 6.1-6.3): Telegram, Signal, Web Widget
2. **Background Processing** (Task 7.1-7.4): Celery workers for async operations
3. **Frontend Interface** (Task 13.1-13.2): Web interface for agent management
4. **API Documentation** (Task 14.2): OpenAPI specs for agent endpoints

## Conclusion

Task 5.3 has been successfully completed with a robust, scalable implementation that:
- ✅ Creates all four specialized agents (Sales, Support, Billing, Operations)
- ✅ Adds context-aware response generation using OpenAI
- ✅ Implements knowledge base integration for accurate responses
- ✅ Includes comprehensive unit tests for agent response generation
- ✅ Meets all specified requirements (2.3, 5.3, 5.4)

The implementation is production-ready and provides a solid foundation for the AI Secretary SaaS platform's multi-agent system.
