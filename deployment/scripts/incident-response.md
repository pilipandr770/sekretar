## Incident Response Process

### 1. Detection and Alert

#### Automated Detection
- Monitoring alerts (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Health check failures
- Error rate thresholds exceeded
- Performance degradation alerts

#### Manual Detection
- Customer reports
- Team member observations
- Third-party notifications

### 2. Initial Response (0-15 minutes)

1. **Acknowledge the incident**
   ```bash
   # Check system status
   curl -f http://localhost:5000/api/v1/health
   
   # Check monitoring dashboards
   # Access Grafana at http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Assess severity and impact**
   - Number of affected users/tenants
   - Business impact assessment
   - Service availability status

3. **Assemble response team**
   - Page Incident Commander
   - Notify Technical Lead
   - Engage SMEs as needed

4. **Create incident channel**
   ```bash
   # Create Slack channel: #incident-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS
   # Invite response team members
   ```

### 3. Investigation and Diagnosis (15-60 minutes)

#### System Health Checks

```bash
# Check application status
./deployment/scripts/health-check.sh

# Check system resources
top
df -h
free -m

# Check service logs
docker logs ai_secretary_app
docker logs ai_secretary_worker
docker logs ai_secretary_postgres
docker logs ai_secretary_redis

# Check database connectivity
docker exec -it ai_secretary_postgres psql -U postgres -d ai_secretary -c "SELECT 1;"

# Check Redis connectivity
docker exec -it ai_secretary_redis redis-cli ping
```

#### Application-Specific Checks

```bash
# Check API endpoints
curl -f http://localhost:5000/api/v1/health/ready
curl -f http://localhost:5000/api/v1/health/live

# Check metrics endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/metrics

# Check error rates
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/monitoring/status
```

#### Database Diagnostics

```sql
-- Check active connections
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;

-- Check long-running queries
SELECT pid, now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start AS duration, query 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE (now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start) > interval '5 minutes';

-- Check database size
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('ai_secretary'));

-- Check table sizes
SELECT schemaname,tablename,pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as size
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'ai_secretary'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;
```

### 4. Mitigation and Resolution

#### Common Resolution Steps

##### Application Restart
```bash
# Restart application services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart app worker scheduler

# Check service status
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
```

##### Database Issues
```bash
# Restart database
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart postgres

# Check database logs
docker logs ai_secretary_postgres --tail 100

# Run database health check
./deployment/scripts/db-health-check.sh
```

##### Memory Issues
```bash
# Check memory usage
free -m
docker stats

# Restart services to free memory
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart

# Scale down non-essential services temporarily
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml scale worker=1
```

##### Disk Space Issues
```bash
# Check disk usage
df -h

# Clean up logs
docker system prune -f
find /var/log -name "*.log" -type f -mtime +7 -delete

# Clean up old database backups
find ./backups -name "*.sql.gz" -type f -mtime +30 -delete
```

FROM pg_stats 
WHERE schemaname = 'ai_secretary' 
ORDER BY n_distinct DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

## Runbooks

### Database Connection Pool Exhaustion

**Symptoms:**
- "connection pool exhausted" errors
- Slow response times
- 500 errors on API endpoints

**Resolution:**
```bash
# Check current connections
docker exec -it ai_secretary_postgres psql -U postgres -d ai_secretary -c "
SELECT count(*) as connections, state 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
GROUP BY state;"

# Kill long-running connections
docker exec -it ai_secretary_postgres psql -U postgres -d ai_secretary -c "
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE state = 'idle' 
AND query_start < now() - interval '1 hour';"

# Restart application to reset connection pool
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart app worker
```

### High Memory Usage

**Symptoms:**
- System memory > 90%
- OOM killer messages in logs
- Application crashes

**Resolution:**
```bash
# Identify memory-heavy processes
docker stats --no-stream

# Check for memory leaks in application
docker exec -it ai_secretary_app python -c "
import psutil
import os
process = psutil.Process(os.getpid())
print(f'Memory: {process.memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB')
"

# Restart services to free memory
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart

# Scale down workers temporarily
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml scale worker=1
```

### Redis Connection Issues

**Symptoms:**
- "Redis connection failed" errors
- Session data loss
- Cache misses

**Resolution:**
```bash
# Check Redis status
docker exec -it ai_secretary_redis redis-cli ping

# Check Redis memory usage
docker exec -it ai_secretary_redis redis-cli info memory

# Check Redis connections
docker exec -it ai_secretary_redis redis-cli info clients

# Restart Redis if needed
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart redis

# Clear Redis cache if corrupted
docker exec -it ai_secretary_redis redis-cli flushall
```

### External API Failures

**Symptoms:**

curl -I https://api.openai.com/v1/models
curl -I https://api.stripe.com/v1/account
curl -I https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/users/me/calendarList

# Check API rate limits
grep "rate limit" /var/log/ai-secretary/*.log

# Implement circuit breaker temporarily
# Update configuration to disable non-critical external calls

# Check webhook endpoints
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/webhooks/stripe/test
```

### SSL Certificate Expiration

**Symptoms:**
- SSL certificate warnings
- HTTPS connection failures
- Browser security errors

**Resolution:**
```bash
# Check certificate expiration
openssl x509 -in /etc/ssl/certs/ai-secretary.crt -text -noout | grep "Not After"
