# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical frontend user interface issues that are preventing proper application functionality. The application currently has several UI problems including non-functional navigation buttons, language switching issues, persistent login forms, and WebSocket connection failures that significantly impact user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the language switcher to properly change the interface language, so that I can use the application in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on the language switcher THEN the interface SHALL change to the selected language
2. WHEN the language is changed THEN all visible text elements SHALL be updated to reflect the new language
3. WHEN a language is selected THEN the URL SHALL update to include the language parameter
4. WHEN the page is refreshed THEN the selected language SHALL persist

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the header navigation buttons (CRM, Inbox, Calendar) to work properly, so that I can navigate between different sections of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on the CRM button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the CRM dashboard
2. WHEN a user clicks on the Inbox button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the inbox interface
3. WHEN a user clicks on the Calendar button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the calendar view
4. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the active menu item SHALL be visually highlighted
5. WHEN a navigation button is clicked THEN the page content SHALL update without full page reload

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the login form to hide after successful authentication, so that I can access the main application interface without obstruction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the login form SHALL be hidden from view
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the main application interface SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN the user is already authenticated THEN the login form SHALL NOT be displayed on page load
4. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the UI SHALL update accordingly without requiring page refresh

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the WebSocket connection to work properly, so that I can receive real-time updates and notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the WebSocket connection SHALL be established successfully
2. WHEN the WebSocket connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
3. WHEN the WebSocket is connected THEN real-time features SHALL function properly
4. WHEN connection issues occur THEN appropriate error handling SHALL prevent application crashes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dropdown menu in the header to work consistently, so that I can access user account options and settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on the dropdown trigger THEN the dropdown menu SHALL open
2. WHEN a user clicks outside the dropdown THEN the dropdown menu SHALL close
3. WHEN dropdown items are clicked THEN the appropriate actions SHALL be executed
4. WHEN the dropdown is open THEN it SHALL display all available user options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for frontend JavaScript errors, so that users receive meaningful feedback when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged appropriately
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN users SHALL receive user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the application SHALL handle them gracefully
4. WHEN errors happen THEN the application SHALL continue to function for unaffected features
