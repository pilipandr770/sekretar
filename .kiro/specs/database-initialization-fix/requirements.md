# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical database initialization issues in the AI Secretary application. The application is currently failing because the database schema is not properly initialized, resulting in "no such table" errors during user registration and authentication. We need to ensure proper database schema creation, data migration, and initial data seeding.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Schema Initialization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to automatically create all required database tables on startup, so that the application can function without manual database setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL check if database tables exist
2. IF tables are missing THEN the application SHALL create all required tables automatically
3. WHEN creating tables THEN the application SHALL use the correct schema for the detected database type
4. WHEN tables are created THEN the application SHALL log the initialization process
5. WHEN schema creation fails THEN the application SHALL provide clear error messages with resolution steps

### Requirement 2: Database Migration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database migrations to run automatically and safely, so that schema changes are applied consistently across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL check for pending migrations
2. IF migrations are pending THEN the application SHALL apply them automatically
3. WHEN migrations run THEN they SHALL be applied in the correct order
4. WHEN migrations fail THEN the application SHALL rollback changes and report errors
5. WHEN migrations complete THEN the application SHALL log the migration status

### Requirement 3: Initial Data Seeding

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want essential system data to be created automatically, so that I can immediately use the application after installation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is first initialized THEN it SHALL create a default admin user
2. WHEN creating the admin user THEN it SHALL use credentials admin@ai-secretary.com / admin123
3. WHEN seeding data THEN it SHALL create necessary system tenants and roles
4. WHEN data already exists THEN the seeding process SHALL skip existing records
5. WHEN seeding fails THEN the application SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4: Database Health Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to validate database connectivity and schema integrity on startup, so that issues are detected early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL test database connectivity
2. WHEN connectivity is established THEN it SHALL validate table schemas
3. WHEN schema validation fails THEN it SHALL attempt automatic repair
4. WHEN repair is not possible THEN it SHALL provide manual fix instructions
5. WHEN validation succeeds THEN it SHALL log database health status

### Requirement 5: Environment-Specific Database Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database initialization to work correctly in different environments (development, testing, production), so that deployment is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development THEN it SHALL use SQLite with full initialization
2. WHEN running in production THEN it SHALL support both PostgreSQL and SQLite
3. WHEN switching database types THEN it SHALL maintain data compatibility
4. WHEN in testing mode THEN it SHALL use isolated test databases
5. WHEN environment changes THEN it SHALL adapt initialization accordingly

### Requirement 6: Error Recovery and Troubleshooting

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and recovery options for database issues, so that I can quickly resolve problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database initialization fails THEN it SHALL provide specific error codes
2. WHEN errors occur THEN it SHALL suggest concrete resolution steps
3. WHEN corruption is detected THEN it SHALL offer repair or recreation options
4. WHEN manual intervention is needed THEN it SHALL provide clear instructions
5. WHEN recovery succeeds THEN it SHALL validate the fix and continue startup
