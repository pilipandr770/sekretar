# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the authentication and database connectivity issues in the AI Secretary application. The main application currently fails to start due to PostgreSQL dependency, while a working SQLite version exists. We need to adapt the main application to work seamlessly with SQLite and ensure proper authentication functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Connectivity Adaptation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the main application to automatically detect and use available database systems, so that I can run the application without external database dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL attempt to connect to PostgreSQL first
2. IF PostgreSQL is unavailable THEN the application SHALL automatically fallback to SQLite
3. WHEN using SQLite THEN the application SHALL disable PostgreSQL-specific features gracefully
4. WHEN switching database types THEN all existing data SHALL remain accessible
5. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL log which database system is being used

### Requirement 2: Authentication System Integration

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to log into the main application using the existing admin credentials, so that I can access all system features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the main application THEN I SHALL be able to log in with admin@ai-secretary.com / admin123
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN I SHALL receive a valid JWT token
3. WHEN I access protected endpoints THEN my authentication SHALL be verified correctly
4. IF authentication fails THEN I SHALL receive clear error messages
5. WHEN I log out THEN my session SHALL be properly terminated

### Requirement 3: Configuration System Unification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified configuration system that works with both PostgreSQL and SQLite, so that I don't need separate application versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL use a single configuration system
2. WHEN SQLite is detected THEN PostgreSQL-specific settings SHALL be disabled
3. WHEN Redis is unavailable THEN the application SHALL use alternative caching mechanisms
4. WHEN external services are unavailable THEN the application SHALL continue to function with reduced features
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the application SHALL adapt without requiring restart

### Requirement 4: Feature Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want all core application features to work regardless of the database backend, so that I have consistent functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using SQLite THEN all CRUD operations SHALL work correctly
2. WHEN using SQLite THEN user management SHALL function properly
3. WHEN using SQLite THEN tenant management SHALL be available
4. WHEN external services are unavailable THEN core features SHALL remain functional
5. WHEN switching between database types THEN data integrity SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Graceful Degradation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle service unavailability gracefully, so that I can continue working even when some services are down.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PostgreSQL is unavailable THEN the application SHALL start with SQLite
2. WHEN Redis is unavailable THEN the application SHALL use in-memory caching
3. WHEN external APIs are unavailable THEN related features SHALL be disabled with clear notifications
4. WHEN services become available THEN the application SHALL automatically re-enable features
5. WHEN errors occur THEN users SHALL receive helpful error messages with suggested actions
