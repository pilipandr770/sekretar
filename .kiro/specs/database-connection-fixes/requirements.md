# Database Connection and Context Fixes Requirements

## Introduction

This document describes requirements for fixing critical database connection issues and application context errors that are preventing the AI Secretary application from running properly. The issues include incorrect database URL handling, missing database tables, and Flask application context errors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Database Connection Logic

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database connection logic to properly detect and use the correct database type based on the DATABASE_URL, so that the application doesn't try to use SQLite URLs as PostgreSQL connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DATABASE_URL contains a SQLite URL, THEN the system SHALL use SQLite connection methods
2. WHEN DATABASE_URL contains a PostgreSQL URL, THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL connection methods  
3. WHEN the database type is detected, THEN the system SHALL NOT attempt connections with the wrong driver
4. IF DATABASE_URL is not set, THEN the system SHALL default to SQLite for development
5. WHEN connection fails, THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about the actual issue

### Requirement 2: Create Missing Database Tables

**User Story:** As a user, I want all required database tables to exist when the application starts, so that I don't see repeated errors about missing tables.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts, THEN the performance_alerts table SHALL exist
2. WHEN database migrations run, THEN all required tables SHALL be created automatically
3. WHEN a table is missing, THEN the system SHALL create it with proper schema
4. IF table creation fails, THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with degraded functionality
5. WHEN tables are created, THEN they SHALL have proper indexes and constraints

### Requirement 3: Fix Application Context Errors

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want background services to work without Flask application context errors, so that monitoring and health checks function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN health checks run, THEN they SHALL NOT cause "Working outside of application context" errors
2. WHEN background services access the database, THEN they SHALL have proper application context
3. WHEN services start, THEN they SHALL initialize with the correct Flask context
4. IF context is not available, THEN services SHALL handle the error gracefully
5. WHEN context errors occur, THEN the system SHALL provide helpful debugging information

### Requirement 4: Fix Redis and WebSocket Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Redis and WebSocket connections to work properly or fail gracefully, so that the application doesn't spam error logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redis URL is empty or invalid, THEN the system SHALL use fallback caching
2. WHEN WebSocket connections fail, THEN the system SHALL not repeatedly retry
3. WHEN external services are unavailable, THEN the application SHALL continue functioning
4. IF service configuration is invalid, THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
5. WHEN services are disabled, THEN they SHALL not attempt connections

### Requirement 5: Improve Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear, non-repetitive error messages that help me understand and fix issues, so that I can maintain the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur, THEN they SHALL be logged once with full context
2. WHEN the same error repeats, THEN it SHALL be rate-limited or suppressed
3. WHEN services fail, THEN the error messages SHALL include actionable information
4. IF configuration is wrong, THEN the system SHALL suggest corrections
5. WHEN debugging, THEN log levels SHALL be configurable and meaningful
