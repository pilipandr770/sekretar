# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds basic API endpoints to make the AI Secretary application more accessible and testable. Currently, the application returns 404 for the root path, making it difficult to verify that the system is working correctly. We need to add fundamental endpoints that provide system status, health checks, and basic API information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer or system administrator, I want to check if the API is running and healthy, so that I can verify the system status and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I make a GET request to `/api/v1/health` THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status code with health information
2. WHEN I make a GET request to `/api/v1/health` THEN the system SHALL include database connectivity status in the response
3. WHEN I make a GET request to `/api/v1/health` THEN the system SHALL include Redis connectivity status in the response
4. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the health endpoint SHALL return a 503 status code
5. WHEN Redis is unavailable THEN the health endpoint SHALL still return 200 but indicate Redis as unhealthy

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access basic API information from the root path, so that I can understand what endpoints are available and get started with the API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I make a GET request to `/` THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status code with welcome information
2. WHEN I make a GET request to `/` THEN the system SHALL include API version information
3. WHEN I make a GET request to `/` THEN the system SHALL include links to available API endpoints
4. WHEN I make a GET request to `/` THEN the system SHALL include basic documentation links

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to get API version and build information, so that I can verify which version of the API I'm working with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I make a GET request to `/api/v1/version` THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status code with version information
2. WHEN I make a GET request to `/api/v1/version` THEN the system SHALL include the API version number
3. WHEN I make a GET request to `/api/v1/version` THEN the system SHALL include build timestamp if available
4. WHEN I make a GET request to `/api/v1/version` THEN the system SHALL include environment information (development/production)
