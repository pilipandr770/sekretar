# Database Seeding Application Context Fix Requirements

## Introduction

The AI Secretary application is experiencing a critical "Working outside of application context" error during database initialization, specifically in the data seeding phase. This error prevents the application from properly initializing with default admin users and system tenants, causing the application to start in a degraded state.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Application Context in Database Seeding

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database initialization to complete successfully without application context errors, so that the application starts with proper admin users and system data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database initializer runs the data seeding process THEN the Flask application context SHALL be properly maintained throughout the seeding operations
2. WHEN database models are accessed during seeding (e.g., Tenant.query.filter_by()) THEN they SHALL execute within a valid Flask application context
3. WHEN the seeding process encounters any database operations THEN all operations SHALL complete without "Working outside of application context" errors
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the database seeding SHALL complete successfully and create the required admin user and system tenant

### Requirement 2: Ensure Context Persistence Across Seeding Steps

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application context to persist across all seeding steps, so that complex seeding operations can access database models reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the DataSeeder._create_system_tenant() method executes THEN it SHALL run within a valid Flask application context
2. WHEN the DataSeeder._create_system_roles() method executes THEN it SHALL run within a valid Flask application context  
3. WHEN the DataSeeder._create_admin_user() method executes THEN it SHALL run within a valid Flask application context
4. WHEN any seeding method calls db.session.commit() THEN the database session SHALL be properly bound to the Flask application context

### Requirement 3: Improve Context Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want clear error messages and automatic recovery when context issues occur, so that I can understand and resolve initialization problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an application context error occurs during seeding THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message explaining the context issue
2. WHEN context errors are detected THEN the system SHALL attempt to create or restore the application context automatically
3. WHEN context restoration fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about the Flask app state and configuration
4. WHEN seeding fails due to context issues THEN the system SHALL provide actionable guidance for resolving the problem

### Requirement 4: Validate Context Management in Background Services

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all background services to properly manage Flask application context, so that no services experience context-related failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN background database health checks run THEN they SHALL execute within proper Flask application context
2. WHEN performance monitoring services access database models THEN they SHALL maintain valid application context
3. WHEN any background service needs database access THEN it SHALL use the ApplicationContextManager for context management
4. WHEN services run outside the request cycle THEN they SHALL create and manage their own application context properly

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Context Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive tests that validate application context management, so that context issues are caught before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running database initialization tests THEN they SHALL verify that seeding completes without context errors
2. WHEN testing background services THEN they SHALL validate proper context management in isolated environments
3. WHEN running integration tests THEN they SHALL simulate the exact startup sequence that causes context errors
4. WHEN context management is tested THEN the tests SHALL cover both successful context creation and error recovery scenarios
5. WHEN all tests pass THEN the application SHALL start successfully without any "Working outside of application context" errors
